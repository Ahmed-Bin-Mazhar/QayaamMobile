              wish to get an economical room according to their budget and needs
              and realtors who can publish their property for rent on a single
              platform. Qayaam comprises both a mobile application and a web
              application. Mainly this project will overcome the difficulty of
              searching for hostels and will also provide the facility to book a
              particular hostel according to needs. The platform also acts as a
              communication channel between realtors and tenants.

              Qayaam benefits realtors by the feature of marketing hostels so
              that their hostelâ€™s information is readily available to tenants.
              The digitization of these marketing and booking activities saves
              time and is hassle-free because of the dedicated platform. The
              information is authentic and is checked and verified by the
              administration. The administration has all the permissions to
              decline any information from the platform that is not authentic.
